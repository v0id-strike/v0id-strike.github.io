                        <h2>Networking Key Terminology</h2>
<p>There are many different terms in the field of information technology. However, we only need to know some of them, only the essential ones. The number of programming languages, functions, protocols, different procedures, areas of application, details, and at the same time, the number of errors that can occur. All these areas are so large that you can specialize your entire career in 1-2 areas.</p>
<p>The key terminology is the rough alphabet we need to know to understand what we will talk about in the other modules. We have created a list with many different but still with the most common protocols and their descriptions to create this foundation. It is important to note that this list is incomplete, and we will cover one or two protocols in other modules. However, we recommend that you review this list from time to time and expand it as you learn new protocols.</p>

<h2>Common Protocols</h2>
<p>Internet protocols are standardized rules and guidelines defined in RFCs that specify how devices on a network should communicate with each other. They ensure that devices on a network can exchange information consistently and reliably, regardless of the hardware and software used. For devices to communicate on a network, they need to be connected through a communication channel, such as a wired or wireless connection. The devices then exchange information using a set of standardized protocols that define the format and structure of the data being transmitted. The two main types of connections used on networks are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">Transmission Control Protocol</a> (<code>TCP</code>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">User Datagram Protocol</a> (<code>UDP</code>).</p>
<p>We need to deal with and know the different and most used protocols. As we have already learned, these protocols are the basis of all communication between our devices and computers in the networks. We have compiled below many of these protocols that we will be dealing with throughout the modules. The better we understand them, the more effectively we can work with them.</p>
<h3>Transmission Control Protocol</h3>
<p><code>TCP</code> is a <code>connection-oriented</code> protocol that establishes a virtual connection between two devices before transmitting data by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment">Three-Way-Handshake</a>. This connection is maintained until the data transfer is complete, and the devices can continue to send data back and forth as long as the connection is active.</p>
<p>For example, When we enter a URL into our web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website using <code>TCP</code>. The server responds by sending the HTML code for the website back to the browser using <code>TCP</code>. The browser then uses this code to render the website on our screen. This process relies on a <code>TCP</code> connection being established between the browser and the web server and maintained until the data transfer is complete. As a result, <code>TCP</code> is reliable but slower than UDP because it requires additional overhead for establishing and maintaining the connection.</p>

<h3>User Datagram Protocol</h3>
<p>On the other hand, <code>UDP</code> is a <code>connectionless</code> protocol, which means it does not establish a virtual connection before transmitting data. Instead, it sends the data packets to the destination without checking to see if they were received.</p>
<p>For example, when we stream or watch a video on a platform like YouTube, the video data is transmitted to our device using <code>UDP</code>. This is because the video can tolerate some data loss, and the transmission speed is more important than the reliability. If a few packets of video data are lost along the way, it will not significantly impact the overall quality of the video. This makes <code>UDP</code> faster than TCP but less reliable because there is no guarantee that the packets will reach their destination.</p>

<h3>ICMP</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">Internet Control Message Protocol</a> (<code>ICMP</code>) is a protocol used by devices to communicate with each other on the Internet for various purposes, including error reporting and status information. It sends requests and messages between devices, which can be used to report errors or provide status information.</p>
<h4>ICMP Requests</h4>
<p>A request is a message sent by one device to another to request information or perform a specific action. An example of a request in ICMP is the <code>ping</code> request, which tests the connectivity between two devices. When one device sends a ping request to another, the second device responds with a <code>ping reply</code> message.</p>
<h4>ICMP Messages</h4>
<p>A message in ICMP can be either a request or a reply. In addition to ping requests and responses, ICMP supports other types of messages, such as error messages, <code>destination unreachable</code>, and <code>time exceeded</code> messages. These messages are used to communicate various types of information and errors between devices on the network.</p>
<p>For example, if a device tries to send a packet to another device and the packet cannot be delivered, the device can use ICMP to send an error message back to the sender. ICMP has two different versions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ICMPv4</code>: For IPv4 only</li>
<li><code>ICMPv6</code>: For IPv6 only</li>
</ul>
<p>ICMPv4 is the original version of <code>ICMP</code>, developed for use with IPv4. It is still widely used and is the most common version of ICMP. On the other hand, ICMPv6 was developed for IPv6. It includes additional functionality and is designed to address some of the limitations of ICMPv4.</p>

<td>This message is sent when a device receives packets too quickly and cannot keep up. It is used to slow down the flow of packets.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another crucial part of ICMP for us is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live">Time-To-Live</a> (<code>TTL</code>) field in the ICMP packet header that limits the packet's lifetime as it travels through the network. It prevents packets from circulating indefinitely on the network in the event of routing loops. Each time a packet passes through a router, the router decrements the <code>TTL value by 1</code>. When the TTL value reaches <code>0</code>, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP <code>Time Exceeded</code> message back to the sender.</p>
<p>We can also use <code>TTL</code> to determine the number of hops a packet has taken and the approximate distance to the destination. For example, if a packet has a <code>TTL</code> of 10 and takes 5 hops to reach its destination, it can be inferred that the destination is approximately 5 hops away. For example, if we see a ping with the <code>TTL</code> value of <code>122</code>, it could mean that we are dealing with a Windows system (<code>TTL 128</code> by default) that is 6 hops away.</p>
<p>However, it is also possible to guess the operating system based on the default <code>TTL</code> value used by the device. Each operating system typically has a default <code>TTL</code> value when sending packets. This value is set in the packet's header and is decremented by 1 each time the packet passes through a router. Therefore, examining a device's default <code>TTL</code> value makes it possible to infer which operating system the device is using. For example: Windows systems (<code>2000/XP/2003/Vista/10</code>) typically have a default <code>TTL</code> value of 128, while macOS and Linux systems typically have a default <code>TTL</code> value of 64 and Solaris' default <code>TTL</code> value of 255. However, it is important to note that the user can change these values, so they should be independent of a definitive way to determine a device's operating system.</p>
<h3>VoIP</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip">Voice over Internet Protocol</a> (<code>VoIP</code>) is a method of transmitting voice and multimedia communications. For example, it allows us to make phone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a traditional phone line, like Skype, Whatsapp, Google Hangouts, Slack, Zoom, and others.</p>
<p>The most common VoIP ports are <code>TCP/5060</code> and <code>TCP/5061</code>, which are used for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">Session Initiation Protocol</a> (SIP). However, the port <code>TCP/1720</code> may also be used by some VoIP systems for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.323">H.323 protocol</a>, a set of standards for multimedia communication over packet-based networks. Still, SIP is more widely used than H.323 in VoIP systems.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, SIP is a signaling protocol for initiating, maintaining, modifying, and terminating real-time sessions involving video, voice, messaging, and other communications applications and services between two or more endpoints on the Internet. Therefore, it uses requests and methods between the endpoints. The most common SIP requests and methods are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Method</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>INVITE</code></td>
<td>Initiates a session or invites another endpoint to participate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>ACK</code></td>
<td>Confirms the receipt of an INVITE request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>BYE</code></td>
<td>Terminate a session.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>CANCEL</code></td>
<td>Cancels a pending INVITE request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>REGISTER</code></td>
<td>Registers a SIP user agent (UA) with a SIP server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>OPTIONS</code></td>
<td>Requests information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agent, such as the types of media it supports.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Information Disclosure</h4>
<p>However, SIP allows us to enumerate existing users for potential attacks. This can be done for various purposes, such as determining a user's availability, finding out information about the user's capabilities or services, or performing brute-force attacks on user accounts later on.</p>
<p>One of the possible ways to enumerate users is the SIP <code>OPTIONS</code> request. It is a method used to request information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agents, such as the types of media it supports, the codecs it can decode, and other details. The <code>OPTIONS</code> request can probe a SIP server or user agent for information or test its connectivity and availability.</p>
<p>During our analysis, it is possible to discover a <code>SEPxxxx.cnf</code> file, where <code>xxxx</code> is a unique identifier, is a configuration file used by Cisco Unified Communications Manager, formerly known as Cisco CallManager, to define the settings and parameters for a Cisco Unified IP Phone. The file specifies the phone model, firmware version, network settings, and other details.</p>

<h2>Wireless Networks</h2>
<p>Wireless networks are computer networks that use wireless data connections between network nodes. These networks allow devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets to communicate with each other and the Internet without needing physical connections such as cables.</p>
<p>Wireless networks use radio frequency (<code>RF</code>) technology to transmit data between devices. Each device on a wireless network has a wireless adapter that converts data into RF signals and sends them over the air. Other devices on the network receive these signals with their own wireless adapters, and the data is then converted back into a usable form. Those can operate over various ranges, depending on the technology used. For example, a local area network (LAN) that covers a small area, such as a home or small office, might use a wireless technology called <code>WiFi</code>, which has a range of a few hundred feet. On the other hand, a wireless wide area network (<code>WWAN</code>) might use mobile telecommunication technology such as cellular data (<code>3G</code>, <code>4G LTE</code>, <code>5G</code>), which can cover a much larger area, such as an entire city or region.</p>
<p>Therefore, to connect to a wireless network, a device must be within range of the network and configured with the correct network settings, such as the network name and password. Once connected, devices can communicate with each other and the Internet, allowing users to access online resources and exchange data.</p>
<p>Communication between devices occurs over RF in the <code>2.4 GHz</code> or <code>5 GHz</code> bands in a WiFi network. When a device, like a laptop, wants to send data over the network, it first communicates with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">Wireless Access Point</a> (<code>WAP</code>) to request permission to transmit. The WAP is a central device, like a router, that connects the wireless network to a wired network and controls access to the network. Once the WAP grants permission, the transmitting device sends the data as RF signals, which are received by the wireless adapters of other devices on the network. The data is then converted back into a usable form and passed on to the appropriate application or system.</p>
<p>The strength of the RF signal and the distance it can travel are influenced by factors such as the transmitter's power, the presence of obstacles, and the density of RF noise in the environment. So, to ensure reliable communication, WiFi networks use techniques such as spread spectrum transmission and error correction to overcome these challenges.</p>
<h3>WiFi Connection</h3>
<p>The device must also be configured with the correct network settings, such as the network name / <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/service-set-identifier-ssid-in-computer-network/">Service Set Identifier</a> (<code>SSID</code>) and <code>password</code>. So, to connect to the router, the laptop uses a wireless networking protocol called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11">IEEE 802.11</a>. This protocol defines the technical details of how wireless devices communicate with each other and with WAPs. When a device wants to join a WiFi network, it sends a request to the WAP to initiate the connection process. This request is known as a <code>connection request frame</code> or <code>association request</code> and is sent using the <code>IEEE 802.11</code> wireless networking protocol. The connection request frame contains various fields of information, including the following but not limited to:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>MAC address</code></th>
<th>A unique identifier for the device's wireless adapter</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>SSID</code></td>
<td>The network name, also known as the <code>Service Set Identifier</code> of the WiFi network</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Supported data rates</code></td>
<td>A list of the data rates the device can communicate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Supported channels</code></td>
<td>A list of the <code>channels</code> (frequencies) on which the device can communicate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Supported security protocols</code></td>
<td>|A list of the security protocols that the device is capable of using, such as <code>WPA2</code>/<code>WPA3</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The device then uses this information to configure its wireless adapter and connect to the WAP. Once the connection is established, the device can communicate with the WAP and other network devices. It can also access the Internet and other online resources through the WAP, which acts as a gateway to the wired network. However, the <code>SSID</code> can be hidden by disabling broadcasting. That means that devices that search for that specific WAP will not be able to identify its <code>SSID</code>. Nevertheless, the <code>SSID</code> can still be found in the authentication packet.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>IEEE 802.11</code> protocol, other networking protocols and technologies may also be used, like TCP/IP, DHCP, and WPA2, in a WiFi network to perform tasks such as assigning IP addresses to devices, routing traffic between devices, and providing security.</p>
<h4>WEP Challenge-Response Handshake</h4>
<p>The challenge-response handshake is a process to establish a secure connection between a WAP and a client device in a wireless network that uses the WEP security protocol. This involves exchanging packets between the WAP and the client device to authenticate the device and establish a secure connection.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Step</strong></th>
<th><strong>Who</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><code>Client</code></td>
<td>Sends an association request packet to the WAP, requesting access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><code>WAP</code></td>
<td>Responds with an association response packet to the client, which includes a challenge string.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><code>Client</code></td>
<td>Calculates a response to the challenge string and a shared secret key and sends it back to the WAP.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><code>WAP</code></td>
<td>Calculates the expected response to the challenge with the same shared secret key and sends an authentication response packet to the client.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Nevertheless, some packets can get lost, so the so-called <code>CRC</code> checksum has been integrated. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check">Cyclic Redundancy Check</a> (<code>CRC</code>) is an error-detection mechanism used in the WEP protocol to protect against data corruption in wireless communications. A CRC value is calculated for each packet transmitted over the wireless network based on the packet's data. It is used to verify the integrity of the data. When the destination device receives the packet, the CRC value is recalculated and compared to the original value. If the values match, the data has been transmitted successfully without any errors. However, if the values do not match, the data has been corrupted and needs to be retransmitted.</p>
<p>The design of the <code>CRC</code> mechanism has a flaw that allows us to decrypt a single packet <code>without</code> knowing the <code>encryption key</code>. This is because the <code>CRC</code> value is calculated using the <code>plaintext</code> data in the packet rather than the encrypted data. In WEP, the CRC value is included in the packet header along with the encrypted data. When the destination device receives the packet, the <code>CRC</code> value is recalculated and compared to the original one to ensure that the data has been transmitted successfully without any errors. However, we can use the <code>CRC</code> to determine the plaintext data in the packet, even if the data is encrypted.</p>
<h3>Security Features</h3>
<p>WiFi networks have several security features to protect against unauthorized access and ensure the privacy and integrity of data transmitted over the network. Some of the leading security features include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Access Control</li>
<li>Firewall</li>
</ul>
<h4>Encryption</h4>
<p>We can use various encryption algorithms to protect the confidentiality of data transmitted over wireless networks. The most common encryption algorithms in WiFi networks are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">Wired Equivalent Privacy</a> (<code>WEP</code>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#WPA2">WiFi Protected Access 2</a> (<code>WPA2</code>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#WPA3">WiFi Protected Access 3</a> (<code>WPA3</code>).</p>
<h4>Access Control</h4>
<p>WiFi networks are configured by default to allow authorized devices to join the network using specific authentication methods. However, these methods can be changed by requiring a password or a unique identifier (such as a MAC address) to identify authorized devices.</p>
<h4>Firewall</h4>
<p>A firewall is a security system that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. For example, WiFi routers often have built-in firewalls that can block incoming traffic from the Internet and protect against various types of cyber threats.</p>
<h3>Encryption Protocols</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">Wired Equivalent Privacy</a> (<code>WEP</code>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">WiFi Protected Access</a> (<code>WPA</code>) are encryption protocols that secure data transmitted over a WiFi network. WPA can use different encryption algorithms, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (<code>AES</code>).</p>
<h4>WEP</h4>
<p><code>WEP</code> uses a <code>40-bit</code> or <code>104-bit</code> key to encrypt data, while <code>WPA using AES</code> uses a <code>128-bit</code> key. Longer keys provide more robust encryption and are more resistant to attacks. However, it is vulnerable to various attacks that can allow an attacker to decrypt data transmitted over the network. In addition, WEP is not compatible with newer devices and operating systems and is generally no longer considered secure. Finally, <code>WEP</code> uses the <code>RC4 cipher</code> encryption algorithm, which makes it vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>However, WEP uses a <code>shared key</code> for authentication, which means the same key is used for encryption and authentication. There are two versions of the WEP protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WEP-40</code>/<code>WEP-64</code></li>
<li><code>WEP-104</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>WEP-40</code>, also known as <code>WEP-64</code>, uses a <code>40-bit</code> (secret) key, while <code>WEP-104</code> uses a <code>104-bit</code> key. The key is divided into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector">Initialization Vector</a> (<code>IV</code>) and a <code>secret key</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>IV</code> is a small value included in the packet header along with the encrypted data and is used to create the key for both <code>WEP-40</code> and <code>WEP-104</code> and is included to ensure that each key is unique. The secret key is a series of random bits used to encrypt the data. However, the <code>WEP-104</code> has a <code>80-bits</code> long <code>secret key</code>. Let us look at the following table to see the differences clearly:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Protocol</strong></th>
<th><strong>IV</strong></th>
<th><strong>Secret Key</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>WEP-40</code>/<code>WEP-64</code></td>
<td>24-bit</td>
<td>40-bit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>WEP-104</code></td>
<td>24-bit</td>
<td>80-bit</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>However, since the IV in WEP is relatively small, we can brute force it, try every possible combination of characters for it, and determine the correct value. Afterward, we can use it to decrypt the data in the packet. This allows us to access the data transmitted over the wireless network and potentially compromise the network's security.</p>
<h4>WPA</h4>
<p><code>WPA</code> provides the highest level of security and is not susceptible to the same types of attacks as WEP. In addition, WPA uses more secure authentication methods, such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-shared_key">Pre-Shared Key</a> (<code>PSK</code>) or an 802.1X authentication server, which provide stronger protection against unauthorized access. Although older devices may not support WPA is compatible with most devices and operating systems. All wireless networks, especially in critical infrastructure like offices, should generally implement at least <code>WPA2</code> or even <code>WPA3</code> encryption.</p>
<h3>Authentication Protocols</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Extensible_Authentication_Protocol">Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol</a> (<code>LEAP</code>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_Extensible_Authentication_Protocol">Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol</a> (<code>PEAP</code>) are authentication protocols used to secure wireless networks to provide a secure method for authenticating devices on a wireless network and are often used in conjunction with WEP or WPA to provide an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>LEAP and PEAP are both based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Authentication_Protocol">Extensible Authentication Protocol</a> (<code>EAP</code>), a framework for authentication used in various networking contexts. However, one key difference between <code>LEAP</code> and <code>PEAP</code> is how they secure the authentication process.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LEAP</code> uses a <code>shared key</code> for authentication, which means that the <code>same key</code> is used for <code>encryption and authentication</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can make it relatively easy for us to gain access to the network if the key is compromised.</p>
<p>However, <code>PEAP</code> uses a more secure authentication method called tunneled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a> (<code>TLS</code>). This method establishes a secure connection between the device and the WAP using a <code>digital certificate</code>, and an encrypted tunnel protects the authentication process. This provides more robust protection against unauthorized access and is more resistant to attacks.</p>
<h3>TACACS+</h3>
<p>In a wireless network, when a wireless access point (WAP) sends an authentication request to a <a href="https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=422947&amp;seqNum=4">Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus</a> (<code>TACACS+</code>) server, it is likely that the <code>entire request packet</code> will be encrypted to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the request.</p>
<p><code>TACACS+</code> is a protocol used to authenticate and authorize users accessing network devices, such as routers and switches. When a WAP sends an authentication request to a <code>TACACS+</code> server, the request typically includes the user's credentials and other information about the session.</p>
<p>Encrypting the authentication request helps to ensure that this sensitive information is not visible to unauthorized parties who may be able to intercept the request. At the same time, it is being transmitted over the network. It also helps prevent tampering with the request or replacing it with a malicious request of their own.</p>
<p>Several encryption methods may be used to encrypt the authentication request, such as <code>SSL</code>/<code>TLS</code> or <code>IPSec</code>. The specific encryption method used may depend on the configuration of the <code>TACACS+</code> server and the capabilities of the WAP.</p>
<h3>Disassociation Attack</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-disassociation-attacks/">Disassociation Attack</a> is a type of <code>all</code> wireless network attack that aims to disrupt the communication between a WAP and its clients by sending disassociation frames to one or more clients.</p>
<p>The WAP uses disassociation frames to disconnect a client from the network. When a WAP sends a disassociation frame to a client, the client will disconnect from the network and have to reconnect to continue using the network.</p>
<p>We can launch the attack from <code>within</code> or <code>outside</code> the network depending on our location and network security measures. The purpose of this attack is to disrupt the communication between the WAP and its clients, causing the clients to disconnect and possibly causing inconvenience or disruption to the users. We can also use it as a precursor to other attacks, such as a MITM attack, by forcing the clients to reconnect to the network and potentially exposing them to further attacks.</p>
<h3>Wireless Hardening</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to protect wireless networks. However, some examples should be considered to increase wireless networks' security dramatically. These are the following, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling broadcasting</li>
<li>WiFi Protected Access</li>
<li>MAC filtering</li>
<li>Deploying EAP-TLS</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disabling Broadcasting</h4>
<p>Disabling the broadcasting of the SSID is a security measure that can help harden a WAP by making it more difficult to discover and connect to the network. When the SSID is broadcasted, it is included in beacon frames regularly transmitted by the WAP to advertise the availability of the network. By disabling the broadcasting of the SSID, the WAP will not transmit beacon frames, and the network will not be visible to devices that are not already connected to the network.</p>
<h4>WPA</h4>
<p>Again, WPA provides strong encryption and authentication for wireless communications, helping protect against unauthorized network access and sensitive data interception. WPA includes two main versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>WPA-Personal</li>
<li>WPA-Enterprise</li>
</ol>
<p>WPA-Personal, designed for home and small business networks, and WPA-Enterprise, designed for larger organizations and uses a centralized authentication server (e.g., RADIUS or TACACS+) to verify the identity of clients.</p>
<h4>MAC Filtering</h4>
<p>MAC filtering is a security measure that allows a WAP to accept or reject connections from specific devices based on their MAC addresses. By configuring the WAP to accept connections only from devices with approved MAC addresses, it is possible to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.</p>
<h4>Deploying EAP-TLS</h4>
<p>EAP-TLS is a security protocol used to authenticate and encrypt wireless communications. It uses digital certificates and PKI to verify the identity of clients and establish secure connections. Deploying EAP-TLS can help to harden a WAP by providing strong authentication and encryption for wireless communications, which can protect against unauthorized access to the network and the interception of sensitive data.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Virtual Private Networks (VPN)</h2>
<p>A <code>Virtual Private Network</code> (<code>VPN</code>) is a technology that allows a secure and encrypted connection between a private network and a remote device. This allows the remote machine to access the private network directly, providing secure and confidential access to the network's resources and services. For example, an administrator from another location has to manage the internal servers so that the employees can continue to use the internal services. Many companies limit servers' access, so clients can only reach those servers from the local network. This is where VPN comes into play, where the administrator connects to the VPN server via the internet, authenticates himself, and thus creates an encrypted tunnel so that others cannot read the data transfer. In addition, the administrator's computer is also assigned a local (internal) IP address through which he can access and manage the internal servers. Administrators commonly use VPNs to provide secure and cost-effective remote access to a company's network. VPN typically uses the ports <code>TCP/1723</code> for <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/pptp-point-to-point-tunneling-protocol-818182">Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol</a> <code>PPTP</code> VPN connections and <code>UDP/500</code> for <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/ipsec-negotiation-ike-protocols/217432-understand-ipsec-ikev1-protocol.html">IKEv1</a> and <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/ikev2ipsec/">IKEv2</a> VPN connections.</p>
<p>This allows employees to access the network and its resources, such as email and file servers, from remote locations, such as their homes or while traveling. There are several reasons why administrators use VPNs. VPNs encrypt the connection between the remote device and the private network, making it much more difficult for attackers to intercept and steal sensitive information. With this, the entire communication is more secure.</p>
<p>Another reason is that VPNs allow employees to access the private network and its resources remotely from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection. This is particularly useful for employees who need to work remotely, such as those traveling or working from home. Additionally, VPNs can be more cost-effective than other remote access solutions, such as leased lines or dedicated connections, because they use the public internet to connect remote users to the private network.</p>
<p>Moreover, we can use VPNs to connect multiple remote locations, such as branch offices, into a single private network, making it easier to manage and access network resources. However, several components and requirements are necessary for a VPN to work:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Requirement</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>VPN Client</code></td>
<td>This is installed on the remote device and is used to establish and maintain a VPN connection with the VPN server. For example, this could be an OpenVPN client.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>VPN Server</code></td>
<td>This is a computer or network device responsible for accepting VPN connections from VPN clients and routing traffic between the VPN clients and the private network.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Encryption</code></td>
<td>VPN connections are encrypted using a variety of encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES and IPsec, to secure the connection and protect the transmitted data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Authentication</code></td>
<td>The VPN server and client must authenticate each other using a shared secret, certificate, or another authentication method to establish a secure connection.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The VPN client and server use these ports to establish and maintain the VPN connection. At the TCP/IP layer, a VPN connection typically uses the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=protocols-encapsulating-security-payload">Encapsulating Security Payload</a> (<code>ESP</code>) protocol to encrypt and authenticate the VPN traffic. This allows the VPN client and server to exchange data over the public internet securely.</p>
<h3>IPsec</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/">Internet Protocol Security</a> (<code>IPsec</code>) is a network security protocol that provides encryption and authentication for internet communications. It is a powerful and widely-used security protocol that provides encryption and authentication for internet communications and works by encrypting the data payload of each IP packet and adding an <code>authentication header</code> (<code>AH</code>), which is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the packet. IPsec uses a combination of two protocols to provide encryption and authentication:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=protocols-authentication-header">Authentication Header</a> (<code>AH</code>): This protocol provides integrity and authenticity for IP packets but does not provide encryption. It adds an authentication header to each IP packet, which contains a cryptographic checksum that can be used to verify that the packet has not been tampered with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.4?topic=protocols-encapsulating-security-payload">Encapsulating Security Payload</a> (<code>ESP</code>): This protocol provides encryption and optional authentication for IP packets. It encrypts the data payload of each IP packet and optionally adds an authentication header, similar to AH.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IPsec can be used in two modes.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Mode</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Transport Mode</code></td>
<td>In this mode, IPsec encrypts and authenticates the data payload of each IP packet but does not encrypt the IP header. This is typically used to secure end-to-end communication between two hosts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Tunnel Mode</code></td>
<td>With this mode, IPsec encrypts and authenticates the entire IP packet, including the IP header. This is typically used to create a VPN tunnel between two networks.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, an administrator could place a firewall in between. In order to facilitate IPsec VPN traffic from a VPN client outside a firewall to a VPN server inside, the firewall would need to allow the following protocols:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Protocol</strong></th>
<th><strong>Port</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Internet Protocol</code> (<code>IP</code>)</td>
<td><code>UDP/50-51</code></td>
<td>This is the primary protocol that provides the foundation for all internet communication. It is used to route packets of data between the VPN client and the VPN server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Internet Key Exchange</code> (<code>IKE</code>)</td>
<td><code>UDP/500</code></td>
<td>IKE is a protocol that is used to establish and maintain secure communication between the VPN client and the VPN server. It is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, and it is used to negotiate and establish shared secret keys that can be used to encrypt and decrypt the VPN traffic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Encapsulating Security Payload</code> (<code>ESP</code>)</td>
<td><code>UDP/4500</code></td>
<td>ESP is also a protocol that provides encryption and authentication for IP datagrams. It is used to encrypt the VPN traffic between the VPN client and the VPN server, using the keys that were negotiated with IKE.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These protocols are necessary for facilitating IPsec VPN traffic because they provide the security and encryption that are required for secure communication over the public internet. Without these protocols, the VPN traffic would be vulnerable to interception and tampering.</p>
<h3>PPTP</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.vpnranks.com/blog/pptp-vs-l2tp/">Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol</a> (<code>PPTP</code>) is a network protocol that enables the creation of VPNs by establishing a secure tunnel between the VPN client and server, encapsulating the data transmitted within this tunnel. Originally an extension of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), PPTP is supported by many operating systems.</p>
<p>However, due to its known vulnerabilities, PPTP is no longer considered secure. It can tunnel protocols such as IP, IPX, or NetBEUI via IP, but has been largely replaced by more secure VPN protocols like L2TP/IPsec, IPsec/IKEv2, and OpenVPN. Since 2012, the use of PPTP has declined because its authentication method, MSCHAPv2, employs the outdated DES encryption, which can be easily cracked with specialized hardware.</p>

<p>Cisco IOS can be managed in several ways, depending on the network device and hardware used. The most commonly used method is the command line interface (<code>CLI</code>), which can also be managed in the graphical user interface (<code>GUI</code>). In addition, it supports various network protocols and services required for network operations. These include:</p>

<h3>VLANs</h3>
<p>Imagine this scenario: A startup called XQ hired a network administrator to create a network for their single-office company, and due to budget limitations, they can only afford one switch and router. The sysadmin of XQ stated that in addition to hosting the web and database servers in the network, staff from different departments will be using it. As a seasoned network security specialist, the network administrator immediately thought about the security attacks that an insider can perform, especially ones abusing broadcast traffic, such as <code>broadcast storms</code>. Therefore, to tackle this problem, the network administrator decided to logically segment the network with <code>Virtual Local Area Networks</code> (<code>VLANS</code>), conceptually breaking down one switch into smaller mini-switches.</p>
<p>A <code>VLAN</code> is a logical grouping of network endpoints connected to defined ports on a switch, allowing the segmentation of networks by creating logical broadcast domains that can span multiple physical LAN segments. With <code>VLANs</code>, network administrators can segment networks based on factors such as team, function, department, or application, without worrying about the physical location of endpoints and users. A broadcast packet sent over one <code>VLAN</code> does not reach any other endpoint that is a member of another <code>VLAN</code>. Because each <code>VLAN</code> is regarded as a broadcast domain, it needs to have its own <code>subnet</code>; for example, the network administrator contracted by XQ can segment the network by departments:</p>

</table>
<p>A myriad of benefits is attained when using <code>VLANs</code>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Better Organization</code>: Network administrators can group endpoints based on any common attribute they share.</li>
<li><code>Increased Security</code>: Network segmentation disallows unauthorized members from sniffing network packets in other <code>VLANs</code>.</li>
<li><code>Simplified Administration</code>: Network administrators do not have to worry about the physical locations of an endpoint.</li>
<li><code>Increased Performance</code>: With reduced broadcast traffic for all endpoints, more bandwidth is made available for use by the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cisco switches provide the <code>VLAN</code> IDs/numbers 1-4094 (<code>0</code> and <code>4095</code> are reserved IDs and cannot be used); IDs 1-1005 (<code>VLAN 1</code> is known as the <code>default VLAN</code> and cannot/should not be altered nor deleted) are known as <code>normal-range</code> <code>VLANs</code>, with IDs 1002-1005 being reserved for <code>Token Ring</code> and <code>Fiber Distributed Data Interface</code> (<code>FDDI</code>) <code>VLANs</code>, while IDs 1006-4094 are known as <code>extended-range</code> <code>VLANs</code>. By default, any customization applied for <code>normal-range</code> <code>VLANs</code> is saved in the <code>VLAN</code> database (the <code>vlan.dat</code> file), in contrast to <code>extended-range</code> <code>VLANs</code>, which do not have their customizations saved. <code>VLANs</code> 2-1001 stored in <code>vlan.dat</code> can have parameters including name, type, state, and maximum transmission unit (<code>MTU</code>).</p>
<h3>VLAN Memberships</h3>
<p>Network administrators can assign the ports of a switch to <code>VLANs</code> either statically or dynamically. Static <code>VLAN</code> assignment, which is the simplest and most common method, involves assigning each port to a <code>VLAN</code> manually using the switch's <code>network operating system</code>; this must be done for all switches separately (it is essential to keep in mind that endpoints connecting to these ports are unaware of the existence of <code>VLANs</code>). In contrast, dynamic <code>VLAN</code> assignment automatically determines an endpoint's <code>VLAN</code> membership based on <code>MAC</code> addresses or protocols. The system administrator can register the <code>MAC</code> addresses in a centralized <code>VLAN</code> management service/database, such as the <code>VLAN Membership Policy Server</code> (<code>VMPS</code>) service, and then the switch queries the database of <code>VMPS</code> to determine the <code>VLAN</code> of the endpoint with that specific <code>MAC</code> address. Regardless of their flexibility and mobility, dynamic <code>VLANs</code> increase administrative overhead.</p>
<p>Security-wise, static <code>VLANs</code> are the more secure option because a port will forever be tied to a specific <code>VLAN</code> ID, unless changed manually afterward. For dynamic <code>VLANs</code>, an attacker could potentially utilize tools such as <a href="https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger">macchanger</a> to spoof the MAC address of legitimate endpoints and attain membership of their <code>VLANs</code>, therefore sniffing all network traffic sent through them.</p>
<h3>Access and Trunk Ports</h3>
<p>Any port on a <code>VLAN</code>-enabled switch must be either an <code>access port</code> or a <code>trunk port</code>. <code>Access ports</code> belong to and can carry the traffic of only one <code>VLAN</code> (or in some cases two, with the second being for <code>voice traffic</code>); any traffic arriving on an <code>access port</code> is assumed to belong to the <code>VLAN</code> the port was assigned. On the other hand, <code>trunk ports</code> can carry multiple <code>VLANs</code> at the same time; <code>trunk links</code> connect two <code>trunk ports</code> on two switches (or a switch and router) to allow information from multiple <code>VLANs</code> to be carried out across switches.</p>
<h3>VLAN Identification</h3>
<p>Standard <code>802.3</code> <code>Ethernet</code> frames do not contain <code>VLAN</code> information; therefore, switches and other <code>VLAN</code>-enabled devices need a mechanism to keep track of all the <code>VLAN</code> information associated with a packet while traversing <code>VLAN</code>-enabled devices. Two main <code>trunking methods</code> are utilized to achieve this, <code>ISL</code> and <code>IEEE 802.1Q</code>.</p>
<h4>Inter-Switch Link (ISL)</h4>
<p><code>Inter-Switch Link</code> (<code>ISL</code>) is a Cisco-proprietary protocol used for trunking between <code>VLAN</code>-enabled devices. Although <code>ISL</code> is one of the first <code>trunking methods</code> (predating <code>802.1Q</code>), it is deprecated and not as widely used in modern Cisco switches (and routers). Instead, most only support the widely adopted <code>802.1Q</code>. <code>ISL</code> encapsulated the entire <code>Ethernet</code> frame, including the original <code>Ethernet</code> header and the <code>VLAN</code> tag, adding its 26-byte header and 4-byte trailer.</p>
<h4>IEEE 802.1Q</h4>
<p>To ensure interoperability of <code>VLAN</code> technologies from the various network-equipments vendors, the <code>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</code> (<code>IEEE</code>) developed the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10004498">802.1Q</a> specification in 1998. The <code>IEEE 802</code> committee had to change the <code>802.3</code> <code>Ethernet</code> frame format by adding a pair of 2-byte fields, <code>TPID</code> and <code>TCI</code> (which consists of three subfields, <code>PCP</code>, <code>DEI</code>, and <code>VID</code>), resulting in a <code>VLAN</code>-compliant <code>802.1Q</code> <code>Ethernet</code> frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/8023_Legacy_8021Q_Ethernet_Frames.png" alt="Diagram showing conversion of a 802.3 Ethernet frame to a 802.1Q Ethernet frame by inserting a 802.1Q header between the source address and length fields. The 802.1Q header includes TPID, PCP, DEI, and VID."></p>
<p><code>Tag protocol identifier</code> (<code>TPID</code>) is a 16-bit field always set to <code>0x8100</code> to identify the <code>Ethernet</code> frame as an <code>802.1Q</code>-tagged frame. <code>Tag Control Information</code> (<code>TCI</code>) is a 16-bit field containing <code>Priority code point</code> (<code>PCP</code>), <code>Drop eligible indicator</code> (<code>DEI</code>) (previously known as <code>Canonical format indicator</code> (<code>CFI</code>)), and <code>VLAN identifier</code> (<code>VID</code>). The main field concerning <code>VLANs</code> is <code>VID</code>, occupying the low-order 12-bits of <code>TCI</code>. Since it is 12 bits, it allows 2^12 - 2 = 4096 (remember, <code>0</code> and <code>4095</code> are reserved) <code>VLAN</code> IDs. Therefore, an <code>802.1Q</code>-tagged frame can contain information for 4094 <code>VLANs</code>; the practice of inserting multiple <code>802.1Q</code> tags within a single packet is known as <code>Double Tagging</code>, introduced by <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/802.1Q/10323/">802.1ad</a>. <code>VLAN tagging</code> is the process of inserting <code>VLAN</code> information into an <code>802.1Q</code> <code>Ethernet header</code>, while <code>VLAN untagging</code> is the process of removing the <code>VLAN</code> information from an <code>802.1Q</code>-tagged <code>Ethernet</code> frame and forwarding the packet to the destined ports.</p>
<h3>VLAN-Capable NICs</h3>
<p>Some <code>network interface cards</code> (<code>NICs</code>) attached to computers/servers support <code>VLAN tagging</code>. Let us see how we can assign a <code>VLAN</code> ID to a <code>NIC</code> using Linux and Windows.</p>
<h4>Assigning NICs a VLAN in Linux</h4>
<p>In Linux, creating a <code>VLAN</code> is done by creating an interface on top of another, called a <code>parent</code> interface. This <code>VLAN</code> interface will tag packets with the assigned <code>VLAN</code> ID while returning packets will be untagged.</p>
<p>To assign a network adapter a <code>VLAN</code> in Linux, many tools can be used, such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip.8.html">ip</a>, <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/nmcli">nmcli</a>, and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/vconfig">vconfig</a> (deprecated). However, first, we need to ensure that the Kernel has the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.4.7/source/net/8021q/vlan.c">802.1Q</a> module loaded:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ sudo modprobe 8021q
</code></pre>
<p>Subsequently, we can use <code>lsmod</code> to make sure <code>8021q</code> was loaded successfully:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ lsmod | grep 8021

8021q                  40960  0
garp                   16384  1 8021q
mrp                    20480  1 8021q
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we need to find the name of the physical <code>Ethernet</code> interface that we will create the <code>VLAN</code> interface on top of, which is <code>eth0</code>:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ ip a

&lt;SNIP&gt;
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a6:ba:3b:08:3a:36 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp0s3
    altname ens3
    inet 94.2X.5X.72/22 brd 94.237.51.255 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 83489sec preferred_lft 83489sec
    inet6 fe80::a4ba:3bff:fe08:3a36/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we will use <code>vconfig</code> to create a new interface that is a member of the desired <code>VLAN</code>, <code>20</code>, for example, on top of <code>eth0</code>:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ sudo vconfig add eth0 20

Warning: vconfig is deprecated and might be removed in the future, please migrate to ip(route2) as soon as possible!
</code></pre>
<p>To use <code>ip</code> instead:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">sudo ip link add link eth0 name eth0.20 type vlan id 20
</code></pre>
<p>Either of these commands will make a new interface called <code>eth0.20@eth0</code>:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ ip a

&lt;SNIP&gt;
4: eth0.20@eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a6:ba:3b:08:3a:36 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
</code></pre>
<p>Then, based on the <code>subnet</code> assigned to the addresses with <code>VLAN 20</code> within the local network, we need to assign the interface an IP address and then start it:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0.20
VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ sudo ip link set up eth0.20
</code></pre>
<p>At last, we can check whether the interface has changed states to up:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">VOIDstrike@htb[/htb]$ ip a | grep eth0.20

4: eth0.20@eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 192.168.1.1/24 scope global eth0.20
</code></pre>
<h4>Assigning NICs a VLAN in Windows</h4>
<p>On Windows, to assign a <code>VLAN</code> for a physical network adapter that supports <code>VLAN tagging</code>, first we need to open <code>Device Manager</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/Windows_Device_Manager.png" alt="Windows search interface showing 'Device Manager' as the best match under Control Panel."></p>
<p>Then we need to click on <code>Properties</code> for the <code>Ethernet interface</code> we want to assign to a <code>VLAN</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/Windows_Device_Manager_Adapter_Properties.png" alt="Device Manager window showing a context menu for ASIX AX88772B USB2.0 to Fast Ethernet Adapter with 'Properties' highlighted."></p>
<p>Within <code>Advanced</code>, there will be a <code>VLAN ID</code> property to which we can assign a value. After clicking <code>OK</code>, if the adapter supports assigning a <code>VLAN</code>, it will be set; otherwise, the window will close, and no <code>VLAN</code> tag will be added to any packets originating from this host:</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/Windows_Device_Manager_Adapter_Properties_VLAN_ID.png" alt="Device Manager window showing properties for ASIX AX88772B USB2.0 to Fast Ethernet Adapter. VLAN ID is selected with a value of 10."></p>
<p>Instead of relying on the GUI, we can use <code>PowerShell</code>. First, let us get the names of all the available physical network adapters using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/netadapter/get-netadapter?view=windowsserver2022-ps">Get-NetAdapter</a> Cmdlet:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Previously, we used <code>Device Manager</code> to assign <code>Ethernet 2</code> to <code>VLAN 10</code>; to retrieve the <code>VLAN</code> ID of the interface, we can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/netadapter/get-netadapteradvancedproperty?view=windowsserver2022-ps">Get-NetAdapaterAdvancedProperty</a> Cmdlet with the <code>-DisplayName</code> flag along with <code>vlan id</code>:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell-session">PS C:\&gt; Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -DisplayName &quot;vlan id&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>We can also set the <code>VLAN</code> ID of a physical network address using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/netadapter/set-netadapter?view=windowsserver2022-ps">Set-NetAdapter</a> Cmdlet along with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/netadapter/set-netadapter?view=windowsserver2022-ps#-vlanid">VlanID</a> flag; this powerful Cmdlet can also be used to customize other properties of interfaces such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/netadapter/set-netadapter?view=windowsserver2022-ps#-macaddress">MAC addresses</a>:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell-session">PS C:\&gt; Set-NetAdapter -Name &quot;Ethernet 2&quot; -VlanID 10
</code></pre>
<p>However, remember that this operation only succeeds if the network interface supports this functionality; otherwise, <code>PowerShell</code> will throw an error indicating that the interface does not support it.</p>
<h3>Analyzing VLAN Tagged Traffic</h3>
<p>We can identify and analyze <code>VLAN</code> tagged traffic on a network with <code>Wireshark</code> using the <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/v/vlan.html">vlan</a> filter. For example, when analyzing a network packet dump, we can inspect packets with <code>802.1Q</code> tagging using the filter <code>vlan</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/Wireshark_VLAN_Filter.png" alt="Wireshark interface showing a packet capture with highlighted RIP v2 response packet, Ethernet II, 802.1Q VLAN, and Internet Protocol details."></p>
<p>Moreover, we can search for packets with a specific <code>VLAN</code> ID; for example, to search for packets having <code>VLAN 10</code>, we can use the filter <code>vlan.id == 10</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/Wireshark_VLAN_ID_Filter.png" alt="Wireshark interface showing a packet capture with highlighted RIP v2 response packet, Ethernet II, 802.1Q VLAN, and Internet Protocol details."></p>
<p>Additionally, to enumerate the used <code>VLAN</code> IDs from a packet dump, we can utilize <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a>:</p>
<p>VLANs</p>

<h3>Security Implications and VLAN Attacks</h3>
<p>Regardless of improving a network's security posture, adversaries can still circumvent the defensive mechanisms put forth by <code>VLANs</code>. Although in modern switched networks, the utilization of <code>VLANs</code> brings numerous advantages (such as simplified network maintenance and improved performance), it also introduces potential security risks, leading to various <code>VLAN</code> attacks. It is essential to grasp the underlying methodologies of these attacks and implement practical mitigation approaches to safeguard networks.</p>
<h4>VLAN Hopping</h4>
<p><code>VLAN hopping</code> attacks enable traffic from one <code>VLAN</code> to be seen by another <code>VLAN</code> without the aid of a router. It exploits Cisco's <code>Dynamic Trunking Protocol</code> (<code>DTP</code>), a protocol used to automatically negotiate the formation of a <code>trunk link</code> between two Cisco devices. An adversary needs to configure a host to mimic/act like a switch to take advantage of the automatic trunking port feature enabled by default on most switch ports. To exploit <code>VLAN hopping</code>, an adversary must be able to physically connect with a switch port that has <code>DTP</code> enabled. The adversary can abuse this connection by configuring a host connected to the switch on that specific port to spoof <code>802.1Q</code> signaling and the <code>DTP</code> packets. If successful, the switch will eventually establish a <code>trunk link</code> with the adversary's host, exposing the network packets, not only for a specific <code>VLAN</code>.</p>
<p>We can use tools such as <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/yersinia">Yersinia</a> to perform <code>VLAN hopping</code> attacks:</p>

<h4>Double-tagging VLAN Hopping</h4>
<p>The <code>double-tagging VLAN hopping attack</code> is an increasingly more sophisticated attack against <code>VLANs</code>. Although <code>VLAN double-tagging</code> is a legitimate practice that entities such as <code>Internet Service Providers</code> (<code>ISPs</code>) utilize (they can use their <code>VLANs</code> internally while carrying traffic from clients that are already <code>VLAN tagged</code>), adversaries can also attempt to abuse it. In a <code>double-tagging VLAN hopping attack</code>, an adversary embeds a hidden <code>802.1Q</code> tag inside an <code>Ethernet</code> frame that already has an <code>802.1Q</code> tag, allowing the frame to go to a different <code>VLAN</code>, which the original <code>802.1Q</code> tag did not specify.</p>
<p>An adversary can carry out this attack following three steps. Bare in mind that this attack only works if the adversary is connected to a port residing in the same <code>VLAN</code> as the <code>native VLAN</code> of the trunk port:</p>
<ol>
<li>The adversary sends a <code>double-tagged 802.1Q</code> <code>Ethernet</code> frame to the switch with the outer header having the <code>VLAN</code> ID of the adversary, which is the same as the native <code>VLAN</code> of the trunk port. Assume that the native <code>VLAN</code> is <code>VLAN 10</code> and that <code>VLAN 30</code> is the <code>VLAN</code> the adversary wants to reach, where the victim resides.</li>
<li>The outer 4-byte <code>802.1Q</code> tag arrives on the switch, and it is seen to be destined for <code>VLAN 10</code>, the native <code>VLAN</code>. After removing the <code>VLAN 10</code> tag, the frame is forwarded on all <code>VLAN 10</code> ports. On the trunk port, the <code>VLAN 10</code> tag is stripped (removed), and the packet is not re-tagged because it is part of the native <code>VLAN</code>. However, the <code>VLAN 30</code> tag is still intact (not stripped), and the first switch has not inspected it.</li>
<li>Subsequently, the switch will look only at the inner <code>802.1Q</code> tag that the adversary sent, and it decides that the frame must be forwarded for <code>VLAN 30</code>, which is the adversary's chosen <code>VLAN</code>. Now, the second switch will either send the frame to the victim port directly or flood it, depending on whether there is an existing MAC address table entry for the victim host.</li>

<h3>VXLAN</h3>
<p>We mentioned previously that the <code>VID</code> field within the '802.1Q' header inside an 'Ethernet' frame is only 12 bits, allowing for 4094 VLANs. While this number of VLANs might be sufficient for small networks, more is needed for data centers and cloud service providers, which require extensive segmentation. Additionally, current Layer 2 networks utilize the <code>IEEE 802.1D</code> <code>Spanning Tree Protocol</code> (<code>STP</code>) to prevent network loops caused by redundant paths. However, some data center operators encounter limitations with <code>STP</code>, such as link blocking, which reduces available ports and prevents resiliency through multipathing. These challenges hinder network efficiency in virtualized environments that rely on Layer 2 physical infrastructure. A critical requirement in such environments is the seamless scalability of the Layer 2 network across the entire data center and even between data centers to allocate computing, networking, and storage resources efficiently. Nevertheless, traditional approaches like <code>STP</code>, while ensuring a loop-free topology, can deactivate many links, further exacerbating the problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7348">RFC7348</a> offers a solution to these problems and limitations in Layer 2 networks by introducing <code>Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network</code> (<code>VXLAN</code>), which is essentially a 'Layer 2 overlay scheme on a Layer 3 network.' <code>VXLAN</code> is specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional Layer 2 networks and cater to the requirements of Layer 2 and Layer 3 data center network infrastructures in a multi-tenant environment with virtual machines (VMs). Operating over the existing networking infrastructure, <code>VXLAN</code> provides an innovative way to seamlessly extend a Layer 2 network. Its primary objective is to facilitate the scaling of Layer 2 networks across expansive data center landscapes, even spanning multiple physical data locations. Each <code>VXLAN</code> overlay is termed a <code>VXLAN segment</code>, ensuring that only VMs within the same VXLAN segment can communicate with each other, thus maintaining network isolation and security. A 24-bit segment ID, known as the <code>VXLAN Network Identifier</code> (<code>VNI</code>), uniquely identifies each VXLAN segment. Adopting VXLAN allows for the coexistence of 16 million <code>VXLAN</code> segments within the same administrative domain, providing scalability and flexibility for modern data centers and virtualized environments.</p>
<h3>Cisco Discovery Protocol</h3>
<p>Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a layer-2 network protocol from Cisco that is used by Cisco devices such as routers, switches, and bridges to gather information about other directly connected Cisco devices. This information can be used to discover and track the network's topology and help manage and troubleshoot the network. This protocol is usually enabled in Cisco devices, but it can be disabled if it is not needed or if it should be disabled for security reasons.</p>

<p>The shown message contains information about the device itself, such as the device name, IP address, port name, and functionality of the router, as well as information about the operating system and hardware platform of the device. Besides, we can see in the first line from the <code>CDPv2</code> that we are dealing with the <code>Cisco Discovery Protocol</code>.</p>
<p>For comparison, we can look at another protocol called Spanning Tree Protocol (<code>STP</code>). The <code>STP</code> is a network protocol that ensures no loops in a network with multiple connections between switches. There are no loops, and it prevents data packets from circulating in a loop and congesting the network.</p>
